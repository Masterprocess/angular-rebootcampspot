# DON'T RUN THIS

Okay, this app needs some major TLC. Don't run this locally, though. There's some pretty major security issues with it. This was a team project, but there were so many issues with the code during development. Nobody was truly competent with Angular, so it suffered as a result. Soon, I'll likely rewrite the app to run in React and React-Native, and get the conditional rendering all up to snuff.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
